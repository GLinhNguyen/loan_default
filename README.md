## Features

- Customizable Filters: Users can apply filters to explore data based on various parameters such as loan type, credit score categories, employment status, and more.

## Ongoing Development
- Enhanced Data Modeling: Refining the data model to include additional relevant variables and relationships, aiming to improve the accuracy and depth of analyses.

- Advanced Metrics Implementation: Introducing more sophisticated metrics, such as debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-value ratios, to provide a comprehensive risk assessment.

- Predictive Analytics Integration: Incorporates machine learning models to predict the probability of loan defaults, assisting in proactive risk management. 

## Technologies Used
- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

- MySQL: As the primary database for storing and querying loan data.

- Python: Utilized for data preprocessing and developing machine learning models to predict loan defaults.
